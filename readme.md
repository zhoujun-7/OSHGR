# Hand Gesture Recognition from an Open-Set Perspective

This is the official repository for the paper "Hand Gesture Recognition from an Open-Set Perspective".

We are working on cleaning the code and the dataset, which expected to be finished in few weeks.


## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate oshgr
```

## Pretrain

```bash
python Pretrain.py
